Hi, I am an PI at [ELLIS Institute Tübingen](https://institute-tue.ellis.eu/en/news/new-PIs-2025) and a group leader at [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/). Previously, I was a [Royal Society Newton International Fellow](https://royalsociety.org/grants/newton-international/) at University of Oxford, and a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) at [Somerville College](https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/). I was a postdoctoral fellow at UT Austin, working with Atlas Wang. I obtained my Ph.D. at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), the Netherlands, under the supervision of Mykola Pechenizkiy and Decebal Constantin Mocanu.

**Research Interests**
======
My overarching research goal is to advance the frontiers of artificial intelligence from multiple perspectives, including but not limited to enhance the capabilities of large foundation models (pre-training and post-training), improve the efficiency and accessibility of AI, develop deeper fundamental understanding of deep learning behavior, and exploring novel architectural designs, and better data curation.

**Hiring Info:** I am actively hiring self-motivated PhD students and postdocs based on [ELLIS Institute Tübingen](https://institute-tue.ellis.eu/de/jobs/phd-positions), with opportunities for joining leading universities such as ETH Zurich, University of Oxford, and other.
